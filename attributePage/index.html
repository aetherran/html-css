          In 1954, aged eight, the boy was sent to study at St. Peter Boarding
          School, a boys' school in the Indian city of Bombay, having traveled
          all the way alone aboard a ship. At that time, already a great music
          lover, he began taking piano lessons, greatly influenced by local
          singer Lata Mangeshkar. At the age of twelve, he formed a band called
          The Hectics, with whom he performed at school events singing hits by
          artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard, and it was at this
          time that he began to be called "Freddie" by friends. Despite being
          appreciated by his elders due to his charisma and musical talent, the
          boy suffered a lot of bullying from other children of his age due to
          his effeminate personality, which led him to become an introspective
          and very shy person when around. strangers. When older, Freddie went
          to live at his grandmother's house, but continued to attend the same
          school until the end of the course, returning to his parents' house
          afterwards.

          Mercury became world famous as lead singer of the hard rock band
          Queen, which he formed with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger
          Taylor in 1971 under the name Smile, with the name "Queen" being
          adopted shortly after the recruitment of bassist John Deacon. The
          band's first albums, Queen and Queen II, had a more limited reception
          in the United Kingdom, and the group achieved some worldwide
          recognition with the album Sheer Heart Attack, with the well-known
          song "Killer Queen", but it was in 1975 that the band reached stardom
          with the album A Night at the Opera, with hits like "Love of My Life"
          and "You're My Best Friend", but mainly with the song "Bohemian
          Rhapsody", a great classic in which Mercury fused rock and roll with
          opera and created what is, until today, considered one of the greatest
          musical recordings in history

          In October 1986, the British press began to report that Mercury had
          been diagnosed with the AIDS virus at a clinic on Harley Street, and a
          reporter from The Sun asked the singer about it when he landed at an
          airport returning from a trip to Japan, and he denied the rumour.[7]
          According to Freddie's partner, Jim Hutton, the singer was diagnosed
          HIV positive in April 1987, but decided to deny all rumors whenever
          questioned.[7] However, Freddie's physical health rapidly
          deteriorated, and he began to appear in public increasingly thin and
          pale, which led the press to publish hundreds of articles speculating
          on the subject.<br />
          In his final days, Freddie lost his sight and was unable to get out of
          bed, so he decided to stop taking his medication on November 10,
          1991,[13] and wait for death.[14] On 22 November, Freddie called
          Queen's manager Jim Beach and asked him to issue a press release to
          publicize his illness, which was released the following day.[10] About
          twenty-four hours after the announcement was made, during the night,
          Freddie died of bronchopneumonia, caused by AIDS.
